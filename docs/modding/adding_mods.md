It is rare for people play vanilla DayZ, modding the game is somehow the **must have** to improve the gaming experience.
Good thing is we have [DayZ steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/221100/workshop/) to make modding easier. 

## **Downloading mods**
You can casually browse through the DayZ workshop and find whatever mods that interest you.
